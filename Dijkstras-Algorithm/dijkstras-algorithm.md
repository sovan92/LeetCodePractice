Absolutely! This is a key concept from **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and plays a big role in how Google Maps (and routing systems in general) compute the **shortest or fastest route** between locations.

## 🧠 What Are Settled, Frontier, and Unvisited Sets?

Think of **Dijkstra’s algorithm** as a process of **exploring a map** from the starting location and gradually learning more about the shortest paths.

To keep track of progress, it uses **three categories of nodes**:

---

### 1️⃣ **Settled Set (Visited / Finalized)**

- These are the nodes for which we have **found the shortest possible distance from the source**.
- Their distances **won’t change** anymore.
- We “settle” one node in every iteration.

> 🟢 Example: “I know for sure that Times Square is 0 km from Times Square (the source).”

---

### 2️⃣ **Frontier Set (Priority Queue / Tentative)**

- These are the nodes that we’ve **seen** but **haven’t finalized**.
- We have a tentative distance for them, but it **could be improved**.
- Stored in a **priority queue** (min-heap) so we can always pick the node with the **shortest known distance**.

> 🔵 Example: “I can get to Central Park in 10 minutes via Broadway, but maybe another route will get me there in 8.”

---

### 3️⃣ **Unvisited Set**

- All the other nodes in the graph that we **haven’t seen yet**.
- We don’t have any distance or connection info about them yet.

> ⚪ Example: “I haven’t even looked at Brooklyn yet.”

## 🗺️ Visualization

```text
Source: A (Times Square)

Step 1:
Settled: []
Frontier: [(A, 0)]
Unvisited: [B, C, D, E]

Step 2:
Pop A from Frontier → Move to Settled
Update neighbors: B, C
Settled: [A]
Frontier: [(B, 4), (C, 1)]
Unvisited: [D, E]

Step 3:
Pop C from Frontier → Move to Settled
Update neighbors: B (maybe shorter), D
Settled: [A, C]
Frontier: [(B, 3), (D, 6)]
```

## ⚙️ In Google Maps Terms

| Set       | Real-World Meaning                                       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Settled   | "We’re sure this place is X minutes from start."         |
| Frontier  | "This is a possible path, let’s keep checking."          |
| Unvisited | "We haven’t considered this location yet."               |

## 🧠 Why Maintain These Sets?

- They prevent us from **revisiting** nodes.
- Let us always expand the **most promising route first** (like A* or Dijkstra).
- Help in maintaining **correctness** and **efficiency**.

Would you like me to draw a small example graph and show how these sets evolve step-by-step as Dijkstra runs on it?
